It\\'s not in conduit untill it enters the bottom of the electrical panel. When the water pump (120v) was installed they just ran it into the conduit with the 240v wiring.\\nI know for certain you can\\'t run low and high voltage in the same conduit, but I thought that if I ran a 1/2\" conduit inside the 2\" for the 120v that would rectify the violation.\\n',\n",
